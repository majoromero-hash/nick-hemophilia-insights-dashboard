    <!-- Chosen Palette: Energetic Oranges -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a multi-tab dashboard. This structure was chosen to logically segment the diverse qualitative insights into thematic areas, making the information easier to digest than a single, long report. The user starts with a high-level 'Overview', then can dive into specific areas like 'Therapy Landscape', 'Clinical Practice', or 'Education'. An 'All Insights Explorer' tab is included for granular, searchable access to the raw data. This non-linear, task-oriented approach allows users to explore based on their specific questions, enhancing usability and discovery. Key interactions include tab-based navigation, dynamic charts, and real-time filtering/searching, which facilitate a fluid exploration of HCP feedback. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Insight counts & timeline. Goal: Inform. Viz: KPI cards & a bar chart (Chart.js). Interaction: Hover on chart bars. Justification: Provides a quick, quantitative summary of the dataset's scope.
        - Report Info: Common topics in insight titles. Goal: Organize. Viz: Horizontal bar chart (Chart.js). Interaction: Hover. Justification: Clearly shows key themes and their frequency, more readable than a word cloud.
        - Report Info: Feedback on specific therapies. Goal: Compare/Organize. Viz: Donut chart (Chart.js) and filterable insight cards (HTML/JS). Interaction: Clicking therapy buttons updates both chart and cards. Justification: Allows direct comparison and deep-diving into sentiments and comments regarding specific treatments.
        - Report Info: Detailed qualitative feedback. Goal: Organize/Inform. Viz: Searchable and filterable table/list (HTML/JS). Interaction: Text search and dropdown filtering. Justification: Provides powerful, direct access to the raw data for users needing to find specific comments or HCP feedback.

                        <li><strong>Infants/PUPs:</strong> Some HCPs are hesitant to use emicizumab in infants without personal clinical trial experience and have concerns about efficacy with lower FIX levels. Others see it as the new standard of care for newly diagnosed babies. A need for smaller vial sizes (e.g., 12mg) for PUPs was identified.</li>

                        <li><strong>PSP Feedback:</strong> Mostly positive, with HCPs happy with nursing support. However, issues like PSP availability in remote areas and cumbersome processes for requesting short-term support were noted. A training gap for PSPs on acquired hemophilia was also identified.</li>
                        <li><strong>Resource Needs:</strong> Requests include a QR code for an SC administration video, a one-pager for a bleed recognition algorithm (HIRT app), and tools to help patients assess bleeds.</li>
